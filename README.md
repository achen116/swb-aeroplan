# SWB Learning Beyond Miles Campaign

This project is a microsite for the non-profit organization, Schools Without Borders (SWB), promoting a one-week fundraising campaign with Aeroplan, a miles loyalty program. This fundraiser, titled "Learning Beyond Miles," occurred between August 24-30, 2015 and raised close to 600,000 miles, which will be used to help educators bring learning outside the classroom.
