	description: "Beatbox Without Borders (BWB) is an organization dedicated to the use and promotion of beatboxing, vocal percussion, and vocal mimesis (vocal sound imitation with an intentional element), as tools for individual and social healing and transformation. BWB’s mission is “Creating a Soundation for All”, a world in which people are using their own humanly produced sounds to overcome suffering, pain and disharmony in themselves and in society, and to connect more deeply with themselves, each other, the natural world, and the spiritual world. Building self-understanding and cross-cultural understanding, through workshops, friendly competitions, collaborative events, talks, publications and story telling, Beatbox Without Borders honors the diversity of vocal mimetic history and experience and seeks to promote these practices not just as art forms, but also as highly significant cultural practices that are rooted in healing and transformative processes to transcend and overcome real individual and social struggles. Inspiration behind BWB is based in the founder Cameron Campbell’s struggle to use his own beatboxing and throat-singing as tools to cure his lyme disease, and stories such as the use if throat singing and animal mimesis among Inuit women to escape the confines of domesticated life.",

	name: "Shadeism", 
	description: "Shadeism: Digging Deeper explores the issue of shadeism (i.e. colourism), the discrimination that exists between lighter-skinned and darker-skinned members of the same community. This issue of skin tone, of certain shades being considered “better” than others, was never missing from conversation while growing up for Director Nayani Thiyagarajah. She was able to feel its harmful presence in conversations and commentary amongst family and friends, but she did not have the language to name it. And so, in many ways, it was easier to ignore its presence, suppress its signs, and normalize its existence. But in 2009, a conversation with her then three-year-old niece Maanu forced Nayani to face the fact that we cannot continue to ignore this issue. Silence will not save anyone from suffering. Through the eyes and experiences of her friends and family, Nayani finally digs deeper to uncover the roots and impacts of shadeism on the women in her life, including herself, and attempts to recover and re-imagine what beauty means for women of colour globally. This film explores where the issue comes from, how it directly affects women individually, and ultimately begins to explore how we can move forward together.",
