	description: "My mission is to promote the use of beatboxing, and vocal mimicry, (human acts of imitating sounds with the mouth, nose and throat) as tools for individual and social healing and transformation. The challenge I am addressing is trying to (re)root beatboxing and vocal mimicry as art forms in cultures that foster individual social healing and transformation. Beatboxing is becoming more and more recognized as an vocal art form in the US and abroad, however it has become a novelty, and has become separated from its historical roots in the Hip Hop movement in New York as an tool for transforming difficult lives into something innovative, positive and groovy. All around the world beatboxing, and traditions of vocal mimicry, such as Inuit throat singing, shamanic animal imitation, nada sound yoga, and many other related practices are also being seen mostly as forms of entertainment, but are also, rooted in historical struggles for individual and social healing and transformation. The power of beatboxing and vocal mimicry to heal and transform the self and society is amazing on many levels, and deserves more attention and awareness than it is currently being given. The driving force behind my work is my experience with beatboxing and vocal mimicry as a tool to help me cure my own lyme disease through my own sonic energy, and my experience of their healing transformative powers across the globe.",
